# Clash Royale AI Card Tracker

Currently, the code is *not* commented very well. This will change soon.

I wrote a report explaining how this AI Assistant was made. It's tailored towards an non-computer-science audience. Please see: [Rough Draft Report](https://github.com/AmarSaini/Clash-Royale-AI-Card-Tracker/blob/master/Clash%20Royale%20Helper/Document/Report.pdf)

If you still want to see the code for the following:

1. The Convolutional Neural Network Architecture (LeNet).

2. Training the first CNN (Convolutional Nerual Network).
3. Predictions on the first CNN.
4. Live (Real-Time) predictions test on the first CNN, to learn opponent's deck.

5. Training the second CNN (Convolutional Nerual Network).
6. Predictions on the second CNN.
7. Live (Real-Time) predictions test on the second CNN, to know which card my opponent is playing.

8. Both CNN's running together during real-time to predict opponent's card cycle + elixir. (This section also has a lot of code regarding the actual AI application).
